Designing a Robust Data Engineering Solution for AdvertiseX

Step 1: Data Ingestion

1.1 Data Streaming Platform Choice: We opted for Apache Kafka due to its reliability and fault-tolerant features, making it a go-to solution for real-time data streaming.

1.2 Kafka Topics Setup: To keep things organized, we created distinct Kafka topics for ad impressions, clicks/conversions, and bid requests.

1.3 Producers at Work: Our savvy producers diligently dispatch data in versatile JSON, CSV, and Avro formats to their respective Kafka abodes.

1.4 Consumer Applications: Enter the consumers â€“ they thrive in real-time, tirelessly processing data with Kafka consumers.

1.5 Batch Processing Finesse: For historical deep-dives, we enlist Apache Flink or Spark to gracefully handle batch processing, gracefully tapping into stored data.

Step 2: Data Processing

2.1 Schemas United: With Apache Avro or Arrow, we bring together disparate schemas, fostering a sense of unity in our data.

2.2 Processing Pipeline Choreography: Apache Beam and Spark waltz onto the stage, orchestrating intricate moves for standardization and enrichment.

2.3 Correlation Ballet: Like a skilled choreographer, our logic adeptly correlates ad impressions with clicks and conversions, syncing them through common identifiers.

2.4 Data Validation and Deduplication Symphony: Validation scripts wield their batons, sweeping aside erroneous or incomplete data. Meanwhile, deduplication mechanisms stand guard, ensuring the sanctity of our data's dance floor.

Step 3: Storage Grandeur for Swift Queries

3.1 Distributed Storage Mosaic: We considered Apache Hadoop HDFS, Amazon S3, and other distributed gems to weave a storied tapestry for our data.

3.2 Data Warehousing Elegance: With tools like Apache Hive and Amazon Redshift, our structured querying unfolds with grace and precision.

3.3 Storage Optimization Ballet: We choreograph partitions in tables, tuning them to the rhythm of relevant dimensions for nimble querying. Enter Apache Parquet, our columnar virtuoso, ensuring storage efficiency.

Step 4: Graceful Error Handling and Vigilant Monitoring

4.1 Anomaly Detection Ballet: Algorithms, our diligent dancers, gracefully detect anomalies using statistical prowess or the finesse of machine learning models.

4.2 Logging and Alerting Symphony: In the orchestra of data, ELK stack or Splunk takes the lead, harmonizing centralized logging and timely alerts for any offbeat data quality issues.

4.3 Automated Remediation Opera: Our scripts, the virtuosos of automation, take the stage, swiftly addressing common data quality issues with a scripted finesse.
